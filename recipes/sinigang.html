<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savory taste.<br>
    It is most often associated with tamarind (Filipino: sampalok), although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent. <br>
    Sinigang means "stewed [dish]", it is a nominalized form of the Tagalog verb sigang, "to stew".[3] While present nationwide,<br>
    sinigang is seen to be culturally Tagalog in origin, thus the similar sour stews and soups found in the Visayas and Mindanao (like linarang)<br>
    are regarded as different dishes and differ in the ingredients used.
